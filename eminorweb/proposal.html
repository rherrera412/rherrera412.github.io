	<h1>E-Minor Engine</h1>
	<h4>Ricardo Herrera, cs184-abx</h4>

	<p>We hope to implement a real time graphics game engine with OpenGL. The main scene will take place in a natural environment such as a forest or mountainside and the gameplay will mostly consist of just looking about the environment.</p>

	<p>This engine will support light effects such as god rays, vignetting, lens flare, and shadows. If time allows, we will integrate real world physics. </p>

	<p>Our planned features include real-time lighting and camera effects on materials, including the light effects mentioned above. We hope to also have physics based mechanics and integrate texture mapping if time allows.</p>

<p>Accomplishing this project will require dedication and a thorough understanding of physically-based lighting in addition to learning how to implement a full 3D graphics engine through OpenGL and support libraries such as GLFW.</p>

	<p>If things go well and we are ahead of schedule we would want to include procedurally generated environments with features such as vegetation dynamically generated.</p>

	<h2>Schedule</h2>

	<p>4/9 - 4/15 In the first week, we want to accomplish setting up the foundation for our engine. We will have an OpenGL base that is at minimum able to render at least simple primitives on the screen along with a source build. We also want to research OpenGL based video game engines and real-time lighting / camera effects.
	<p>
	4/16 - 4/22 -> figure out simple operations, how to load meshes and lighting, primitive textures, look into procedurally generating objects
	<p>4/23 - 4/29 -> By the end of the third week we want to have most if not all of our planned deliverables completed (lens flare, god rays, etc). We also will integrate texture mapping
	<p>4/30 - 5/6 -> test, The final week should mostly be dedicated to testing and debugging errors. If time allows, we would also finish implementing features we originally hoped to have such as physics based mechanics.
