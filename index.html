        Technically, it's Ricardo, but its <i>whutever</i>. I'm a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Film Studies. I have a passion for computer graphics, film, science, and art. I love to learn. Originally from Costa Mesa, CA. This website is still under construction.

	My first 3D animated short! My notable contribution to this masterpiece is Marshmallow (or as like my mom refers to it, "El Bombon"), which I modeled and animated.

	The piece was my group's submission for Cal State Long Beach's 24 Hours Challenge; as the name implies this was made in under 24 hours. The prompt was "make a 1 minute short that contains a physical or metaphorical wall".

     <em><b><i>The Only Love a Mans Ever Known</i> (exp. 2017) </b></em> <br>
    This project is for my Advanced Digital Animation course. In essence, its a short about the pangs of alcoholism, but that is all I can say for now. I am working on audio, lighting, modeling, and post-production for this short.
