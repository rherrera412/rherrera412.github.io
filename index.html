                  Technically, my name is Ricardo, but its <i>whutever</i>. I'm a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Film Studies. I have a deep passion for computer graphics, movies, and art. 
                  <br><br>
                  I am currently in the process of setting up a <a href="siggraphindex.html">SIGGRAPH Student Chapter for UC Berkeley</a>.
                  <br><br>And in case you're wondering, lighting and rendering are my favorite parts of the pipeline.  <br>

          <h4> 
          This project was made for UC Berkeley's Advanced Digital Animation course, CNM190 (Fall 2016 - Spring 2017). In essence, its a short about the pangs of alcoholism, but very layered, revealing new meanings with every view. 
          <h4> I worked on the sound effects, lighting, modeling, and post-production for this short. Specifically, the lighting I am most proud of is during the liquor store scene, as we experiemented with what felt like every possible variation. Since we were going for a Tell-Tale -chiaroscuro- comic book-esque look, directional lights were crucial. 
          <h4> I am really proud of the music I wrote for this, especially when I found my peers humming the music at random times. <i> Only Love</i> has won an award at the East
          LA film festival, and is being considered for other film festivals!<br >

        <h2><i>Sweet Victory</i> (2016)</h2>

        <h4>
        My first 3D animated short! My notable contribution to this masterpiece is Marshmallow (or as like my mom refers to it, "El Bombon"), which I modeled and animated. Learning Maya and other software was so rewarding, and this project helped me explore some of their capabilites. 
        <h4> Fun fact: the chocolate fountain was for a time a bifrost simulation with very viscous chocolate. However, the renderfarm hates us and it didn't go as planned. This was made during my first semester of UCBUGG, probably the best class I have taken while at Berkeley.

        The piece was my group's submission for Cal State Long Beach's 24 Hours Challenge; as the name implies this was made in under
        24 hours. The prompt was "make a 1 minute short that contains a physical or metaphorical wall". You learn a lot about your animation partners when trapped in a computer lab for 24 hours. We all left with a new connection with one another; and sleep deprivation.

          This short was made for the Campus Movie Festival @ UC Berkeley. I worked on the music, some color grading, and story ideas. (I wrote the music in 30 minutes, while waiting to get medication).<br>
