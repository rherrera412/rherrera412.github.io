      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Technically my name is Ricardo, but call me Ricky. I am an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Film. I have a deep passion for computer graphics; from the theory to its artistic applications, I am enthusiastic for anything CG. That includes (but is not limited) to film, video games, and AR/VR.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been fortunate enough to work on a few short 3D animated films while being a facilitator for UCBUGG: 3D Modeling & Animation. At the moment, I am a research assistant on the NOME project, supervised by Professor Carlo Sequin.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite graphics topics are light transport and rendering.

      <h2>Short Films</h2>

      <h3>Brilliance (2018)</h3>
            <iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/661UVnnjeHs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p> The UCBUGG staff got together and created this wonderful short film about an italian man with electricity problems. I did most of the lighting for this short, as well as sets and camera. This was one of my favorite projects to light up! </p>
            <p> Lighting night scenes was a challenge that took many iterations, so I am very pleased with the end result.</p>

            <h3>Only Love (2017)</h3>
            <iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EiJ86TQ2_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p> This project was made for UC Berkeley's Advanced Digital Animation course, CNM190 (Fall 2016 - Spring 2017). In essence, its a short about the pangs of alcoholism, but very layered, revealing new meanings with every view.
            <p> I worked on the sound effects, lighting, modeling, and post-production for this short. Specifically, the lighting I am most proud of is during the liquor store scene, as we experiemented with what felt like every possible variation. Since we were going for a Tell-Tale -chiaroscuro- comic book-esque look, directional lights were crucial.
            <p> I am really proud of the music I wrote for this, especially when I found my peers humming the music at random times. <i> Only Love</i> has won an award at the East
            LA film festival, and is being considered for other film festivals!
