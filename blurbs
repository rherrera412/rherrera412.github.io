Sweet Victory (2016)
My first 3D animated short! I try to bring this up in any conversation I have, especially at parties!
Marshmallow (or as like my mom refers to it "El Bombon") ...


Walden (2016)
The piece was my group's submission for Cal State Long Beach's 24 Hours challenge; as the name implies this was made in under 24 hours. The prompt was "make a 1 minute short that contains a phsyical or metaphorical wall"


The Only Love a Man's Ever Known (2017)
This project is for my Advanced Digital Animation course. In essence, its a short about pangs of alcoholism, but that is all I can say for now.
